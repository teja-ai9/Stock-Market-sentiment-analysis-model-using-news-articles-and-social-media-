# Stock Price Prediction using Sentiment and Emotional Analysis from Social Media- News Articles
In general, the traditional stock value prediction ML models have poor accuracy. Stock prices fluctuate rapidly multiple times within a second. Investing in stocks using a hunch may throw us into losses, but taking an informed decision will always yield good results. There are a lot of
stock value prediction models out in the market, but alas! all those models have poor accuracy.
The objective of this project is to build a Stock Market sentiment and emotional analysis model using social media and news articles. 

Reliance stock is employed as an example, and we evaluate price fluctuations based on financial and sentiment/emotion indices. Less than 5% variation in the predicted Reliance stock price compared to the actual stock price would be our target business criteria. Lasso Regression model was seen to give the best result for validation- selecting minimum features and MAPE- 4.48, RMSE-130.

For Final Test data Prediction, the model perfomed exceptionally well by giving a MAPE of 0.63. which has been deployed using Flask.

The ultimate CRISP- ML Flow of the Project is as follows:
