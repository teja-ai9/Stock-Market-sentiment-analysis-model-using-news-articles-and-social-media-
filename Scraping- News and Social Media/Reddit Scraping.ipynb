      "* Markets are forward looking and react to futuristic anticipations. Rather than looking at current conditions, it will think like \"how much better things can be in coming 6-8 months\" on the upside and \"how much worse can it be\" on the downside. This is the most important point which most people know but choose to ignore\n",
      "* A typical characteristic of bull markets is that they are often hated and people will be in disbelief & denial while the market will keep going up. On the other hand, if you find most people around you are approving of the market movement & wish to participate, it's time to be cautious as market top might be near\n",
      "* Markets follow contrarian view instead of consensus view. It will do opposite of what most people think it should be doing.\n",
      "* Always follow the market, never try to lead it ahead, otherwise it will crush you from behind. Market in general is very lucky. 99% of it's bets turn out to be right. All you have to do is place your bet on the market's bet\n",
      "* Always be ready for 10-15% correction at any time even in a super strong bull market. These corrections are healthy and market uses them to clear the froth accumulated as a result of the continuous bull run and to also remove the weak hands. A disciplined bull market will do this time to time. Don't be afraid of them\n",
      "* Market does not behave based on news rather news is shown based on the market movement. At a time both good news and bad news are present in the system. Based on what market does, relevant news justifying the move is shown. Market will do what it has to do anyway\n",
      "* Any time is the right time to invest for longer term. Far more money has been lost in waiting for market corrections, then in corrections themselves. If you wish to capture 25-30k points in the index in next 10-15 years (which you will do) why bother for 500/1000 point correction. It may never come\n",

      "* Market normally does extremes on both the ends since it can be irrational in short term. People try to anticipate it's movement without following the price and hence lose lot of money. Have trust on the market & on it's luck.\n",
      "* You will find 3 types of traders in the market 1) who doesn't know when to take losses and walk away 2) who has strict stop losses and walks away after taking losses 3) who take losses and at the same time take opposite trade in market's new direction. They are quickly able to change/adapt themselves based on market's new trend. Category 1) is thrown out of market sooner or later.

      "Company's market cap is \\~5500Cr (Take a tolerance of 10%). FY 22 revenue is \\~6000Cr. Net profit is \\~600 Cr. ROE: \\~18% (Exceptional imo). The revenues and profits have shown a consistent and considerable growth from last 10 years (That's the period I observed company for).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Business Prospects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyplex is into business of packaging, IMO, FMCG is a business with least risk and as FMCG grows packaging needs grow. The company is among largest producers of packaging materials and has a global reach. They have a plant upcoming in USA, in FY24 which would lower their operational cost and they are engaging into downstream integration which IMO would shift their business from commodity to value-added products (I am bullish on business prospects need help finding dirt here).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Management:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Management is \\~30-40 years old. This is important for me since, it reassures my trust in maturity of management. I could not find a dirt on them (Need help here).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Crude prices: Crude is a raw material to them, I am not concerned since their margin of profit is high and has consistently increased. It does not reflect in net profit due to consistent Capex by company.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rumours that promoters are selling their stack:** I do not care because rumours also say buyers are bidding 30-40% higher than current share price. If they do sale stock at that price to institutional investors, I am rather more confident that share is undervalued.\n",

      "z46nsu\n",
      "I had 12 Mindtree shares before 23rd November but then it vanished from my portfolio. I checked internet snd got to know that their was a merger of Mindtree and LTI. The ratio mentioned was 100 shares of Mindtree will become 73 shares of LTI. Fractional shares will be encashed. Now my concern is all my 12 shares will be encashed as they are less than 100 shares OR I will get 12*0.73= 8.76 i.e 8 LTI shares and 0.76 LTI share will be encashed. Also if encashment happens for me for either 12 Mindtree shares or 0.76 LTI shares which price will be considered for encashments. And when And how I will get my funds. Please reply asap. Thanks.\n",

Usually, people who have high-risk tolerance and want a lucrative amount of returns will choose it. Small caps companies are categorized as low market caps which has high growth projection. A small-cap stock can convert to midcap or even a large cap depending upon its growth over the years. As per Groww’s report, [95% of Indian companies](https://groww.in/p/small-cap-stocks) are categorized under small cap due to their market cap. The general perception from people is, Small cap companies are new entrants to the stock market or present over a long period but need help to deliver good returns. So, investing in them could be challenging considering the risk associated with the.\n",
      "\n",
      "But historically numerous companies have proved that wrong ad given a tremendous amount of returns for the investors. It is with us to figure out a growth potential company. So, let us look at 4 key factors to find the finest company.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Analyze the core fundamentals**\n",
      "\n",
      "Analyzing fundamentals plays a key role which investing in a stock. It demonstrates to us the overall state of the company and its intrinsic value.\n",
      "\n",
      "* PE ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "determines the Price to Earning of a share. Usually, the P/E ratio for the small caps will be higher as they are in the bracket of growth \n",
      "\n",
      "The P/E ratio formula is \n",
      "\n",
      "= Share Price/Earning per share\n",
      "\n",
      "It tells the actual price of a share by considering its earnings per share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately there is no such rule to invest only consider PE, but it is better at least if the company stock is near to the industry PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "* The debt-to-equity ratio helps to analyze the total debt taken by the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, if the company has low Debt to Equity ratio then it is good to consider.\n",

      "\n",
      "Earnings \n",
      "\n",
      "Every time when you look for a small-cap stock, you should principally focus on the earnings report. Whether or not the growth is recorded in the overall revenue and profit. A growing company will always record progress by expanding its team with an upward move.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) **Figure out the sector**\n",

      "Pitching the right sector for investment will directly result in the ROI. Sometimes the market may go uptrend due to the sentiment of the investors. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "4) **Investors friendly**\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at their past events and board meetings. Is the company actively meeting on a regular basis? or actively involved in the company’s AGM. Most small-cap companies may not give dividends to their shareholders and it is acceptable as they in expanding their presence.\n",

      "\n",
      "PROS - \n",
      "\n",
      "1. According to the four year cycles this cycle is coming to an end, this is basically a pattern that bitcoin generally goes up 3  years then bleeds 1 year and then starts the next cycle ,more on it - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWdOztDkv4) , [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti0qHClHmPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti0qHClHmPs),hence maybe we should consider getting into it before the next cycle starts.\n",
      "2. Next bitcoin halving is on  **March 22, 2024** ,so a littles over a year ,bitcoin halving in lay man terms means the people who mine bitcoin get half the reward hence less bitcoin is dumped into the market and supply reduces in open market, which by supply and demand if demand is constant/rising price goes up.\n",
      "3. Institutional interest ,with a lot of Bitcoin etfs propping up here and there countries supporting bitcoin ( mainly el salvadore for now ...) ,cbdcs coming on blockchain( like digital rupee) this legitimizes the space and hece big money is coming in right now( recent example Aptos look it up)\n",
      "4. War and inflation rather than being a con is actually a positive for the concept of bitcoin, it's inflation resistant, supply hard capped at 21 million, and goverments cannot control it's transactions, only reason it dropped so much is coz it is treated as a high risk asset (which it definitely is currently...) \n",
      "5. A lot of leverage got flushed out of the system and companies like vauld(Promoted by Akshat shrivastava), Voyager, celsius, etc got bankrupt ,which might signify a new beginning .\n",
      "6. It's already down around 70-75% at 20k so there is some margin of safety and is better than buying at 69k(which i am sure a lot of you will fomo when it reaches those levels)\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS - \n",
      "\n",
      " Anything can happen in crypto hence treat it as a highly speculative investment and don't give above 10% allocation (not financial advice ofcourse you can give 0-100% allocation but only after doing research yourself)\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy : I am currently DCA ing , on Binance(only reliable exchange out there) auto invest ,historically fridays are when bitcoin is the lowest so i am investing that day of the week for the next six months, I can easily give a refferal link for binance but i won't coz it will take away the credibilty from this post, also in crypto there are a lot of scams so be aware\n",

      "## India's fiscal deficit widened to INR 6.20 trillion in April-September 2022-23 from INR 5.27 trillion in the comparable year-earlier period. That was equivalent to 37.3 percent of the government’s estimate for this financial yea. Total receipts advanced 10 percent to INR 10.12 trillion, while expenditure was up to INR 18.24 trillion. In February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set the fiscal deficit target at 6.4% of gross domestic product for 2022/23 starting April, compared to 6.7% in the previous fiscal year\n",

      "## The Euro Area economy expanded 0.2% on quarter in the three months to September of 2022, following a 0.7% growth in Q2, in line with market expectations, flash estimates showed. It was the weakest GDP growth since the rebound from Covid-19 restrictions in Q2 2021 and indicators are pointing to a shift from expansion to a contraction in Q4, as the inflation rate continues to break records with the energy prices still remaining elevated and the ECB raising sharply interest rates. Among the biggest economies, the GDP growth rates in Italy (0.5%) and Germany (0.3%) surprised on the upside. The GDP of Spain and France grew only 0.2% as a post-COVID boom in the tourism and leisure industries faded. On the other hand, smaller economies including Latvia (-1.7%), Belgium (-0.1%), and Austria (-0.1%) already contracted. Year-on-year, Euro Area’s GDP advanced by 2.1%, also in line with expectations\n",

      "## Annual inflation rate in the Euro Area continued to break record high levels and jumped to 10.7% in October of 2022 from 9.9% in September. Figures came higher than market forecasts of 10.2%, preliminary estimates showed. Prices of energy continue to have the biggest impact (up 41.9% vs 40.7% in September), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (13.1% vs 11.8%), non-energy industrial goods (6% vs 5.5%) and services (4.4% vs 4.3%).

      "## Chicago wheat futures jumped over 6% to a two-week high of $8.8 per bushel on Monday October 31st, after Russia decided on the weekend to end participation in an agreement that allowed grain exports from Ukraine, following an attack on its ships in the port of Sevastopol in the annexed Crimea. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's largest wheat exporters and an agreement has been put in place in July to let the secured passage of grains on the Black Sea. Such deal has helped to alleviate pressure on the wheat price which skyrocketed to record high $12.8 per bushel in May of 2022, while lower grain demand and easing supply concerns have also weighed. No ships moved through the established maritime humanitarian corridor on Sunday, but the United Nations agreed with Ukraine and Turkey to unblock 16 grain ships. \n",

      "## The number of mortgage approvals for house purchases in the United Kingdom, commonly seen as an indicator of future borrowing, fell to 66.8 thousand in September of 2022 from an upwardly revised 74.4 thousand in the previous month, missing expectations of 67 thousand and below the 6-month average of 67.2 thousand. It was the sharpest monthly decrease since February of 2021, in line with the Bank of England’s effort to slow the economy as interest rates are set aggressively higher to curb inflation. Consequently, the effective rate on new home loans rose by 29bps to 2.84 percent in the period, the most since the start of the central bank’s rate-tightening cycle. Approvals for remortgaging, which only capture remortgaging with a different lender, decreased slightly to 49.1 thousand from 49.5 thousand in August, but remained higher than the past 6-month average of 47.1 thousand\n",

      "yhiszy\n",
      "I have noticed a lot of you have entered these commodity companies recently. I guess it's mostly because the stocks were hot or in news or because \"steel is important, so it needs to be used\" or such explanations. But, all of the companies are commodity companies which are cyclical in nature. Tldr: These companies operate in a cyclical sector and entering now or even few months back doesn't give you a margin of safety. You need to follow underlying commodity prices to time your entry.  You have to be close to bottom of cycle to make money. Longer explanation: It's not about any of these companies. It's not that Vedanta, sail, tata steel, hindalco are a bad or good companies. It's about the sector the company operate in. The sectors are cyclical.  The companies mine commodities and sell it at \"market price\". Now unlike Nestle, HUL, Dr Reddy's lab, Titan or Infosys they don't sell at whatever price they want to. They sell commodities at the market price. The market price is decided by external factors which essentially boils down to supply and demand, also somewhat dollar price. So the profit margins of these companies vary to an large extent, hence the profitability. So inorder to be able to make money from a cyclical company, you have to enter the stock when the commodity prices are very low(when these companies are not doing well ) and sell it when commodity prices become high. Last quarter, these companies did really well because of high commodity prices and now commodity prices are lowering, so are are these companies profits and subsequently stock prices too. I will be attaching some recent quarterly earnings as comments for a better understanding. While, I can't say whether commodity prices will go up or down. Know that these aren't \"long term\" stocks. They have to be followed closely. You can't buy vedanta today at around 280 and expect in 10 years that it will touch 500. It totally depends on the commodity cycle. The past stock prices are the best proof of this phenomenon. You will notice a relationship between profit margins, commodity prices and stock prices.\n",

      "1. Options are an extension of the stocks\n",
      "\n",
      "Stocks are limited to bullish or bearish. With options, investors can stay in markets and bet short or long with less risk and lower capital outlay.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Avoid Emotions:\n",
      "\n",

      "yffnhx\n",
      "Since a lot of stocks which IPOed in the recent past have crashed recently, I am reposting a post I posted some months back in another sub.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- \n",
      "\n",
      "**Rule #1:** \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't think of yourself as a major value investor when applying for IPOs. Benjamin Graham, the father of Value Investing had a rule that he would never invest in IPOs. Don't think you are applying for an IPO because of your major skills in fundamental analysis either. You aren't applying because you \"believe\" in their business model whatever that means. Accept the fact that you are applying to make listing gains. Understanding this & accepting this fully is very important to the remaining rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rule #2:**  \n",
      "Have a Stop Loss on the price you paid for the IPO - let's say 10% - i.e. if you paid Rs. 100 during the IPO subscription, you **will** sell if it ever hits Rs. 90 whatever happens. \n",
      "(if not 10%, then find an appropriate percentage which is right for you) \n",
      "\n",
      "You will not keep the stock because you believe in their fundamentals or because you think they have a great business model. If it opens gap down on listing day & falls below 90 before you can sell, you then dump it right away at whatever price you can get. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no way, you should be holding the stock after it falls more than 10%. And heaven forbid, don't even think about averaging down. Remember Rule #1 - you didn't buy the stock because you are a value investor. Nor did you buy the stock because of your skillful fundamental analysis. You bought it for listing gains. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Rule #3:**   \n",
      "If it lists at a profit, then you need to lock in your profit. You don't need to sell right away, but you need to make sure you don't lose the profit if the stock crashes later & goes below your IPO buy price. IMHO, the way to do this is to learn about trailing stop losses. You regularly keep incrementing your stop loss price as the stock goes up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR**   \n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO game is like trading & not like investing. So do risk management like any good trader does. Stop Losses are a very basic risk management tool which all traders use. With the right Risk Management, even if you many of your IPOs go bust, you will still be up net-net \n",
      "\n",
      "---  \n",
      "\n",
      "**And don't forget Rule #1 - you didn't subscribe to the IPO because you are a value investor or because you are a black belt Fundamental analyst. You subscribed for listing gains**.\n",

I already have a PPF account where I invested 1.5 lakhs in the first year of 2019-2020 as I thought the compounding and EEE was good. Then the Govt decided to reduced the interest and I have invested only minimum amount in PPF for the last 2 years.\n",

Also, even when I get 10% CAGR in ELSS it will still be better than PPF but I have to pay LTCG tax on profits above 1 lakh.\n",

I didn't have much time to learn so I decided to go through the smallcase way to invest, but after even holding them for so long, no smallcase gave me any positive return, which is why I decided to quit smallcase investing and started investing after my own research 2-3 months ago.

I wanted to know if these are the correct tickers and what’s the additional info they have ? Like 2016I makes it look like the SGB was Issues in 1st quarter of 2016.

      "First, see where the NIFTY500 is trading. Is it above the 40 week moving average? Also, the 40wk MA should be rising or flat. The 40MA should not be declining. If it is declining, then do not trade. Stay in cash. You are going to trade in the direction of the market at all times.\n",

      "Next, sort the stocks with the highest returns weekly, monthly, 3 monthly and 6 monthly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "From that look for a stock which has made at least one 20%+ move in one week in the past 200 days. You can play with 200 day lookback period. For me 200 days works, you can use a smaller lookback period of 1 month or so. Finding this 20%+ week is the most important step as it puts you in the stocks which will move the fastest. This is your signal bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume on the 20%+ week should be more than 100,000 at least. Do  not bother buying volumes below this level. You need good volumes to enter and exit your trades. So, ignore 20%+ weeks with low volumes. Not worth your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that pick only those stocks which have a daily price band of 10% or 20%. Do not trade 5% price bands even if this is your favourite stock. Most of the stocks in your list which have moved most will be in the 5% price band. This is good as you can screen them out and only focus on the ones which can give the highest return in the shortest period of time. You can check daily price bands [here](https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/daily-price-bands-reports)\n",
      "\n",
      "From the above list look for stocks which are consolidating or correcting for at least 2 weeks or more from the recent high. This doesn't have to be the 52week high or all time high, just the recent high. If a stock is consolidating for more than 200 days, ignore them. Also, if a stock has corrected more than 50% from it's highs ignore them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note down the highest point for each stock or the first pivot point below the highs. If there is a second pivot point after the first one then that will be your breakout point.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "As you can see, IHF has largely remained in the \"AA\" rating bucket over the last 3 years. Definition of AA:\n",
      "\n",
      "Instruments with this rating indicate high degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry very low credit risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn't it surprising that the safety of the issue (according to CRISIL and CARE) has largely remained the same over a period where the company saw significant deterioration in its revenues, profits and AUMs? This dynamic doesn't sit right in our opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "**2. What do past subscriptions say?** \n",

      "\n",
      "Clearly, overall and HNI subscription levels have come down, but that hasn't been the case for retail investors.\n",

      "It is possible that retail investors largely make their decision primarily based on the credit rating on the issue? Should they be looking beyond that? \n",

      "**3. What does the company's cashflow say?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, IHF's NCD assessment by retail investors and rating agencies seem to be out of sync v/s the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings us to the last way of evaluating this issue - Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR). Essentially, ICR is the ratio of Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and Interest payments. In simple terms, this metric tells you if the company makes enough money to cover the interest payments it needs to fulfil.\n",
      "\n",
      "ICR should at least be 1.5x for a company to comfortably service its debt. At 1.5x, the company earns 150% of what it needs to pay as interest obligations. Let's look at IHF's ICR over the last 3 years. \n",

This evaluation would help you take trades with most potential for profit and least probability of risk. Such evaluation is carried out through Fundamental Analysis. Fundamental Analysis involves evaluating the company’s financial status by studying its Balance Sheet, Income Statement (also called Profit and Loss Statement), Cash Flow Statement, and its Financial Ratios. Out of these, Financial Ratios help us compare two or more financial parameters of the company to understand its financial status better. Using these ratios, you can understand the company’s financial health and also compare the company to its peers that operate in the same industry or sector. One such parameter is Debt to Equity Ratio. In this blog, we will find out more about Debt to Equity Ratio and the debt to equity ratio formula. \n",

These are the lesser-known stocks to the larger public out there. Usually, these are less preferred by investors due to the limited information about the fundamentals, and businesses are unreliable or unavailable. But the best penny stocks in India are popularly known for generating multi-bagger stock, i.e. returns within a few trade sessions. \n",

These stocks hold the chances of giving higher returns when they are hitting the upper circuits for several days.

      "Stock Market is considered as a great instrument to build wealth. However, you might discover many experts suggesting to use long term investing approach to build wealth. In fact, many Popular Big Investors like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Radhakishan Damini, Raamdeo Agrawal, and Institutional Investors also prefer long term investment strategy over short term. Why do they prefer so?\n",
      "\n",
      "1) No need to keep Modifying Investment with every Market Volatility!\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock Markets are always very volatile. Timing them and predicting where they will move on a particular day is not easy. In fact, it is very hard to do. Using Long Term Investing approach, you are not required to do so!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can simply invest the money and wait until the company and its share doesn’t hits your Target Levels. An Investor doesn’t requires to get indulge in the daily volatility of share price. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Let Compounding play its role in Long Term! \n",
      "\n",
      "As per Albert Einstein (famous physicists), compounding is one of the Eighth Wonders in the World. If you know some about finance, you may know about the magic of compounding. If you don’t know, let me tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compounding is a kind of phenomenon that happens when something keeps growing in the long term. As the asset keeps growing, the amount of growth of an asset also keeps increasing with the time. To understand it, let’s see an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, you have invested ₹1000 in ABC Stock. In the first year, share price grew by 20% means your invested money would have increased by ₹200 to ₹1200 (₹1000 + ₹200). In next year, if your investment again grew by 20%, then this time, your investment value will not increase by ₹200. It will increase by ₹240 (20% of ₹1200).\n",

      "this question is just a renewal of the same old question, \"How do I get started in the stock market?\", but I have searched a lot and have talked to many people but all they say is...\"Experience se aata hai Bhai\". this is correct, absolutely correct! but anywhere I look, all I see are bits and pieces of information. The reason I asked this question is, if a newbie person like me comes and wants to know, what I should learn before getting into it, he/she will get a proper answer.\n",
